        <h1>Etymology</h1>
        <p>
            The word derives from Greek &#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3AE; (mousike; "art of the Muses"). In Greek mythology, the nine Muses were the goddesses
            who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics,
            and myths in the Greek culture. According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c.,
            musike, from Old French musique (12c.) and directly from Latin musica "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the]
            source of Spanish musica, Italian musica, Old High German mosica, German Musik, Dutch muziek, Danish musik)." This is derived
            from the "...Greek mousike (techne) "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse"
            (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In classical Greece, [the term "music" refers to] any art in
            which the Muses presided, but especially music and lyric poetry."

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            Prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites. Flutes are often discovered,
            carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one end like the Japanese
            shakuhachi. The Divje Babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments
            such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the Ravanahatha, have been recovered from
            the Indus Valley Civilization archaeological sites. India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the worldâ€”references
            to Indian classical music (marga) are found in the Vedas, ancient scriptures of the Hindu tradition.[28] The earliest and
            largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in China and dates back to between 7000 and 6600 BC.[29]
            The "Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal", found on clay tablets that date back to approximately 1400 BC, is the oldest surviving notated
            work of music.
